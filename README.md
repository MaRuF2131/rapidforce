# RapidForce Humanitarian Management System üöÄ

**A Custom-Built PHP Solution for Humanitarian Operations**  
*Developed without frameworks - Pure PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL*

## Project Overview üåê

RapidForce is a complete web-based management system I built from scratch to coordinate humanitarian work, volunteer activities, and donation tracking. The system features:

- Admin dashboard for work distribution
- Volunteer registration and profiles
- Donation processing
- Media galleries
- Comprehensive reporting

### Key Statistics
- **15,000+** lines of custom code
- **45+** interconnected PHP scripts
- **100%** framework-free implementation

## Architecture & Technical Approach üèóÔ∏è

### Core Stack
| Component       | Technology Used          | Why I Chose This |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Backend         | Pure PHP 7.4+            | Full control without framework constraints |
| Frontend        | Vanilla JS + CSS3        | No jQuery/Bootstrap dependency |
| Database        | MySQL with PDO           | Security through prepared statements |
| UI Components   | Custom-built             | Perfect pixel control |

### Notable Implementation Patterns

1. **Custom MVC-like Structure**
```php
// Example of my controller-like approach
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $validator = new input_test\test();
    $cleanInput = $validator->text($_POST['field']);
    // Business logic...
}
Security First Approach

Implemented input validation class (admin_input_test.php)

Custom session management

PDO for SQL injection prevention

Performance Optimizations

Lazy loading images with lozad.js

Binary search for volunteer lookups

AJAX-powered partial page updates

Key Components Deep Dive üîç
1. Volunteer Management System
Files: aboutvolunteer.php, search.php, profile.php

My Implementation:

Developed a binary search algorithm for O(log n) searches

Created a dynamic profile viewer with resizable windows

Implemented AJAX form submissions without jQuery

javascript
// Vanilla JS AJAX example from search functionality
fetch('profile.php', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({id: volunteerId, name: volunteerName})
})
2. Custom UI Toolkit
Files: tool.js, tool.css

What I Built:

Resizable/draggable window system

Animated components without libraries

Responsive design with pure CSS

javascript
// My custom resize function from tool.js
function resize(magic) {
    magic.style.top = ((window.innerHeight-magic.offsetHeight)/2.0)+"px";
    magic.style.left = ((window.innerWidth-magic.offsetWidth)/2.0)+"px";
    // ... 85 lines of custom drag/resize logic
}
3. Database Layer
Files: database.php, distribution_search.php

My Approach:

Singleton-like database connection

Custom query builder patterns

Data validation before DB operations

php
// My database handling approach
function database() {
    try {
        $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$server;dbname=$database",$username,$password);
        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
        $_SESSION['conn'] = $conn;
    } catch(PDOException $e) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
What My Code Demonstrates üß†
1. Problem-Solving Approach
Modular Thinking: Created reusable components like tool.js

Performance Consciousness: Implemented binary search over linear

Edge Case Handling: Comprehensive input validation

2. Learning Journey
Security: Evolved from basic mysqli to PDO prepared statements

Code Organization: Progressed from spaghetti code to MVC-like separation

UI/UX: Improved from basic tables to interactive components

3. Unique Solutions
Custom Form Validation: Built form_input_test.php before discovering popular libraries

Dynamic Content Loading: Pioneered AJAX implementations before learning frameworks

Responsive Design: Crafted media queries through trial and error
